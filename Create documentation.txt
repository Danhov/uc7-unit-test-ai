StudentConverter and PlayerAnalyzer Test Readme
Introduction
This readme provides essential information for running tests for the StudentConverter and PlayerAnalyzer components of the project. These components are part of a Gradle project written in Java 17. Testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring that the functionality of these components works as expected and contributes to the overall quality and reliability of the project.

Test Description
StudentConverter Tests
The StudentConverter component is responsible for converting student data between different formats, such as JSON and CSV. The tests for this component focus on verifying the correctness of the conversion process. These tests cover scenarios where data is converted from one format to another and then back to the original format, ensuring that there is no loss of information during the process. Additionally, edge cases, such as handling empty or malformed data, are also included in the test suite to guarantee robustness.

PlayerAnalyzer Tests
The PlayerAnalyzer component is designed to analyze and process data related to players, such as their performance statistics. The tests for this component aim to validate the accuracy of the analysis and ensure that it provides meaningful insights. These tests include cases where player data is analyzed under different conditions, such as various game scenarios or changing data inputs. The goal is to verify that the PlayerAnalyzer consistently produces reliable and useful results.

Running Tests Locally
To run the tests locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine. Use the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to Project Directory: Change your working directory to the root of the project:

bash
Copy code
cd <project_directory>
Ensure Java 17: Make sure you have Java 17 installed on your machine. You can check your Java version by running:

Copy code
java -version
If you don't have Java 17 installed, you can download and install it from the official Oracle website or your preferred package manager.

Build the Project: Build the Gradle project by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew build
This command will download dependencies and compile the project.

Run Tests: Execute the tests by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew test
This command will run all the tests for both the StudentConverter and PlayerAnalyzer components. You'll see the test results in the terminal.

Review Test Reports: Optionally, you can generate and review detailed test reports, including coverage reports, by running:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
The test report will be available in the build/reports directory.

By following these steps, you can locally run and verify the tests for the StudentConverter and PlayerAnalyzer components. These tests help ensure the correctness and reliability of these essential project functionalities.
