StudentConverter and PlayerAnalyzer Test Readme
Introduction
This readme provides essential information for running tests for the StudentConverter and PlayerAnalyzer components of the project. These components are part of a Gradle project written in Java 17. Testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring that the functionality of these components works as expected and contributes to the overall quality and reliability of the project.

Test Description
StudentConverter Tests
The StudentConverter component is responsible for converting student data between different formats, such as JSON and CSV. The tests for this component focus on verifying the correctness of the conversion process. These tests cover scenarios where data is converted from one format to another and then back to the original format, ensuring that there is no loss of information during the process. Additionally, edge cases, such as handling empty or malformed data, are also included in the test suite to guarantee robustness.

PlayerAnalyzer Tests
The PlayerAnalyzer component is designed to analyze and process data related to players, such as their performance statistics. The tests for this component aim to validate the accuracy of the analysis and ensure that it provides meaningful insights. These tests include cases where player data is analyzed under different conditions, such as various game scenarios or changing data inputs. The goal is to verify that the PlayerAnalyzer consistently produces reliable and useful results.

Running Tests Locally

StudentConverterTest Class
The StudentConverterTest class is designed to test the functionality of the StudentConverter component, which is responsible for converting student data between different formats. This class contains a series of test cases that cover various scenarios, both positive and negative, to ensure the reliability and correctness of the conversion process.

In the positive test cases, the class verifies that the conversion produces the expected results for different types of students. For example, it tests whether the converter correctly identifies high achievers, young exceptional high achievers, students who passed, and those who failed. Each positive test case sets up a specific student instance, converts it using the studentConverter, and asserts that the expected outcome matches the actual result.

In contrast, the negative test cases focus on handling exceptional situations. The class includes a test case for an empty input array, ensuring that the converter handles empty data gracefully. Additionally, it verifies that the converter correctly handles null input by expecting a NullPointerException to be thrown. These negative test cases help ensure that the StudentConverter component behaves correctly in scenarios where unexpected or invalid data is encountered.

By combining these positive and negative test cases, this class thoroughly tests the StudentConverter component's functionality, ensuring that it correctly converts student data and handles exceptional cases effectively.

PlayerAnalyzerTest Class
The PlayerAnalyzerTest class serves as the test suite for the PlayerAnalyzer component, which is responsible for analyzing and processing data related to players, including their performance statistics. This class contains a comprehensive set of test cases, encompassing both positive and negative scenarios, to ensure the correctness and reliability of the player analysis functionality.

In the positive test cases, the class verifies that the PlayerAnalyzer calculates player scores correctly under various conditions. For instance, it tests normal players, junior players, and senior players, each with different ages, experiences, and skill levels. The test cases set up player instances, calculate their scores using the playerAnalyzer, and assert that the expected score matches the actual result. Additionally, there's a test case for calculating scores for multiple players, ensuring that the analysis functions correctly in a multi-player context.

In contrast, the negative test cases focus on handling exceptional situations. One test case validates that the PlayerAnalyzer correctly handles null skills when provided, expecting a NullPointerException to be thrown. Another test case assesses the behavior when an empty player list is passed, ensuring that the analyzer returns a score of 0.0 in this case.

By covering these positive and negative test cases, the PlayerAnalyzerTest class rigorously tests the PlayerAnalyzer component, ensuring that it produces accurate player scores while gracefully handling exceptional cases. This thorough testing contributes to the reliability and robustness of the player analysis functionality.
